        <p>
          <i>One, Less Than Ten</i> is a game that came to me in a
          <a id="dream-link">dream</a>. It is a lot like
          <i>Rock, Paper, Scissors</i> but with a little math involved.
        </p>
        <div id="dream">
          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact:</b>On January 18th 2024, I literally did have a dream.
            In the dream I was talking to someone. I don't remember about what.
            I don't remember a lot about the dream. But near the end of the
            dream I said something like "I can make a quick game on the fly".
            And they said "no you can't!" And I proceeded to teach this person
            how to play this game as I made it up. When I woke up, I wrote it
            down.

        <h2>The Rules of the Game</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Two players square off</li>
          <li>On the count of 3 both assume a hand sign</li>
          <li>The valid hand signs are numbers 1 through 10</li>
          <li>The player with the larger number wins</li>
          <p>EXCEPT:</p>
          <li>When total of both sign numbers added together equal 9</li>
          <p>OR</p>
          <li>
            The total of both sign numbers added together equals
            <a id="dream-link2">11</a>
          </li>
          <div id="dream2">
            <p>
              In my dream, i used "added together minus 10 equals 1" because the
              dream was really selling the name of the game.
            </p>
